# Temporal Freezing (March 2016)
This repository contains the PsychoPy programme for my Talented Student Programme (TSP) 2016 lab research on Motoyoshi's visual temporal freezing under the supervision of Alex Holcombe. 


## The Visual Illusion of Temporal Freezing
[Motoyoshi (2007)] presented a novel visual illusion termed Temporal Freezing, in which surface features are seen as standing still when they are veridically changing. Against a background of uniformly transitioning colour or texture, a subjective figure (marked out by the notches of four concentric ring inducers) is presented centrally on screen for a period ranging from 80ms to 600ms. It was discovered that the colour or texture within the figure is commonly perceived to be frozen when the figure was present for less than 200ms. 

Few projects have since examined this, hence little is known about other determinants of such a visual phenomenon. 

### The Current Project
The current project was therefore proposed to discover additional factors influencing the strength of the temporal freezing effect, in hopes of uncovering the neuro-cognitive underpinnings. Several manipulations known to modulate perception completion were explored, including entropy contrast [(Gillam & Chan, 2002)] and support ratio ([Shipley & Kellman, 1992]; [Kogo et al., 2010]).
